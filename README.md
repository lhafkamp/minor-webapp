# Github App for Everything Web
An overview page of all the students from the minor: Everything Web. With this app we can all quickly find our fellow students and go to their Github patients.

To use the app simply go to:
https://lhafkamp.github.io/minor-webapp/week%202/assignment%201%20-%20data/#main

You can click on any student to see more information about that student or use the searchbar to search for the student you had in mind.

# Resources:
The data from each student is fetched from api.github.com

# Wishlist:
Currently I'm only using the features that are available from the Github API without oauth2. If I would use oauth2 I would expand the user pages by showing what repositories they've been working on lately.
